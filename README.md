# Cairo-Metro-Application
Developed a comprehensive Cairo Metro navigation application using Kotlin and Android Studio, implementing the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to calculate both the shortest and all possible routes between stations. The application helps commuters optimize their journey through Cairo's metro network by providing efficient path-finding solutions.
